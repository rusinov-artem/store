- test piromid. we have it reversed
- we have real data in tests
- we have empty_db.yaml in every case


Why should we clean test? Test code will rote if we not refactoring it.
It get harder and harder to understand
and we get point when no body understand it and it will be deleted.
Then the production code will rote


1 no right scrolling ever

2 no real date in the test! Real date does not explain what is going on

3 Change "fred" and every test broken. It sign of a bad design. If it happend in production code it is obvius

4 Testing through the user interface.

5 What are we testing???? Not obvius

6. What realy belongs to this test
    the numbers totalAmound and

7. from red to green.

8. Refactor. Remove duplication by extract custom assertion

9. Where to put helper methods? What about to put them bellow test cases?

10. Test format one time

11. Get rid if constructor inside a constructor
Test data should explain what test are doing

12. When we clean the code we have a goal to go to. And also we have a progmatism

TDD. helps our code to be clean.
It reduces amount of bugs
It gives us a curage to make changes. Even experimental

=========================================================

extract till you drop.
How can you be sure function doing only one thing

method belongs to different class. But it takes it by argument


switch type of movies!
